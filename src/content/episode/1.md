### Transcript

I am a Twin Flame, specifically known as a Divine Feminine. I feel called to share my journey, struggles, obstacles, and triumphs with you. It's comforting to hear others' stories, and I want you to know that the Twin Flame journey is truly remarkable. If you're facing difficulties right now, remember that this phase won't last forever. There's a profound purpose behind the challenges we encounter, contributing to collective healing. Twin Flames hold a powerful role, and I'll delve deeper into this as we go along. Just remember, you're not alone, and I assure you, you will overcome this.

On the other side of healing, there awaits light, joy, bliss, and many wonderful experiences. Let's start with my personal journey. The realization that I was a Twin Flame struck when I unexpectedly fell in love with someone. This person was married at the time, but when I looked into his eyes, I experienced a profound awakening. It was like diving into an ocean of love, where I felt his love for me and a deep connection.

I was certain he was my person, but when I shared my experience with him, he didn't feel the same way. This triggered a challenging period known as the dark night of the soul. I was overcome by depression, spending days in despair on my living room floor. This unreciprocated love unearthed my shadows – fears of abandonment, unworthiness, shame, and more. I couldn't fathom why this love wasn't returned.

Seeking help proved futile as nobody understood the magnitude of my experience. Conversations with him were equally perplexing. Although we had a deep soul connection and profound love, he maintained that his marriage prevented anything further. I had to embark on my healing journey alone. Feeling isolated was one of the most challenging aspects, as no one truly comprehended my ordeal.

In search of answers, I stumbled upon the concept of Twin Flames – individuals who share a unique and intense bond. Discovering others had faced similar situations brought a glimmer of hope. However, the majority of stories I encountered involved physical relationships, which left me questioning if my experience qualified. Despite the uncertainty, I trusted my instincts and resonated with the Twin Flame concept.

Allow me to share insights about podcasts. Listeners have approached me, expressing their interest in starting their own podcasts. If you're among them, I want to introduce you to Spotify for Podcasters. This platform enables effortless podcast creation, distribution, and even the possibility of earning money. As an avid user myself, I've connected with people worldwide, deepened my spiritual growth, and transformed my life. It's free and easy to use, and you can explore it through the Spotify for Podcasters app or by visiting www.spotify.com/podcasters.

What pulled me out of that bleak period was a realization – if I could feel such profound love for this person, what if I directed that love towards myself? This idea sparked hope and provided a pathway back to self-love, healing, and wholeness. My journey towards unconditional self-love has been truly transformative.

The Twin Flame journey isn't just about any kind of love. It's not the conditional, codependent, addictive, or messy love that society often portrays. My upbringing, marked by addiction, an absent father, and codependent dynamics, shaped my understanding of love. However, the Twin Flame experience shattered these notions, confronting me with a love I couldn't possess. This journey compels us to redefine love as unconditional, compassionate, patient, and accepting.

Transmuting these learned behaviors and embracing unconditional love can be arduous, particularly for those raised in similar environments. Twin Flames often come from such backgrounds to break these patterns and establish new templates for love – the only authentic template.

In the age of Aquarius and the new Earth, our purpose is to love unconditionally. I've reached a point where I no longer need to be with my Twin Flame to feel complete. Balancing my energies and embracing self-love has been incredibly empowering. The journey involves dismantling old patterns and trusting in our heart's truth, even when it conflicts with external narratives.

I encourage you to connect with your heart daily. Amidst the noise of the mind and societal expectations, your heart holds the truth. My personal experiences have led me to portals of higher understanding and undeniable truths. Integrating these truths into the 3D world can be challenging, but as within, so without. Tuning into your heart can bring clarity, peace, and healing.

Thank you for joining me today. I hope this conversation has provided insight and comfort. If you enjoyed it, please subscribe for more discussions about the Twin Flame journey and its transformative power. Have a wonderful day, and we'll reconnect soon.
